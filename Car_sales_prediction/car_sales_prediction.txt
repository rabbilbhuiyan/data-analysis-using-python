# Predicting car sales price using Cardekho data set
Problem statement of the project: Finding the second hand car sales price

# 1. First careat a new environment at anacoda (it could be done for any new project)
 - Reason for creating new environment: there will be lot of libraries to installed at that environemnt
 - becAUSE each and every project has dependency of diffferent libraries, so it good to utilize the only 
	libraries for that project
 # How to creat anaconda environment
  - open anaconda prompt (by default the environemnt is 'base' - so need to change it
  - write 'create -n myenv python=3.7' (change myenv as your env e.g carprediction, also python version if needed)
  - enter
  - then write 'y'
  
  - now have to activate the environment after that
  - activate myenv(carprediction)
  
 2. Working directory (launch jupyter notebook)
  - then change the patah (to same working path)
  - d:
  - cd D:\ML_project\Car_sales_prediction
  - write 'dir' - you can see all the directories 
  
  -- now running jupyter notebook for this particular path and environment
  - just write 'jupyter notebook' + enter
  
  
  For opening pyspark : the procedure is same( anaconda prompt -> directiory path -> pyspark)
  
 3. creating model
