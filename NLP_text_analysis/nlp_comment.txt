Sci-kit learn packages in Machine Learning process
 
Macine Learning process:

What question are we trying to answer -> Find data to help answer question -> Process data -> Build model -> Evaluate model -> Improve the model further

Sci-kit learn simplify the entire pipeline of ML process

Scikit-learn is a simple and efficent tools for data mining an data analysis. e.g
1. Classfication
2. Regression
3. Clustering
4. Dimensionality reduciton
5. Model selection
6. Preprocessing


Two kinds of machine learning model e.g
1. Tradional, Algorithmic models -> Sci-Kit learn
2. Neural Network Models/ deep learning -> Tensorflow, pytorch
